                <p><b>If you think about the market at all, you may have asked yourself at some time, “What determines
                    stock prices?” Every TV
                    dummy that you listen to on CNBC will tell you a one word answer, “Earnings”.
                    And they’re wrong.</b></p>
                <p>Carnivores don’t even ask that question. It’s the wrong question! We ask a different question…we ask
                  “What determines
                  stock price movement?” After all, we only care about stock price movement - as that is what will
                  determine profit or
                  loss in a trade, the only thing that really matters, right? And the answer to what determines stock
                  price movement is
                  more complex and multi-dimensional than something simple like “earnings”.</p>
                <p>We postulate that the companies value today is irrelevant, particularly in relation to other stocks.
                  Overvalued,
                  undervalued, it doesn’t matter. Because…by whose definition? Some idiot on TV? Some analyst sitting in
                  New York? Value
                  isn’t determined by any of them. Value is determined by the combined energy of buying and selling of
                  millions of people.
                  Earnings? Earnings don’t matter. If earnings mattered, why are millions of people sitting with losing
                  positions and
                  saying to themselves, “Well, the company has great earnings, I wonder why my stupid ass is holding
                  onto this stock now
                  that it’s down 20% or 50% from where I bought it?</p>
