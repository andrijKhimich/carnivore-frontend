                    </p>
                    <p><b>2. Purpose of Agreement.</b>This Agreement provides the context for the relationship between
                      you and CT.</p>
                    <p><b>3. Risks, Obligations, Responsibilities.</b></p>
                    <p><b>3.1 Acknowledgement of Risk.</b> You acknowledge that there is a high degree of risk in
                      investing and trading in the stock
                      market, stocks, ETF's, ETN's and other securities and that such trading and investing may not be
                      suitable for all
                      people. You agree by virtue of subscription that you are using this service of your own accord for
                      informational and
                      entertainment purposes only and that CT has no responsibility for your individual decisions to
                      utilize the information
                      on this site or delivered through this site or by our texting service in any way. You agree that
                      you understand that if
                      there is anything that you don't understand about our service that you consult your attorney or
                      your financial advisor
                      or CPA and by subscribing, you agree that you have read and understand this Agreement. You agree
                      that our responsibility
                      to you is to deliver to you by text message potential trading ideas for your consideration. You
                      acknowledge that CT is
                      not a broker dealer, advisor, or SEC or FINRA approved organization and that CT does not charge
                      you or receive any other
                      form of payment from you for your trading or investing, wherever that may be done and that no
                      account is opened by CT
                      and that CT is not directing any of your trades or investments and that you, and you alone, are
                      directing your own
                      investments and trades, that you and you alone are responsible for your results and that CT has no
                      responsibility for
                      your results in any way. You also acknowledge that you understand that members of the CT team may
                      from time to time hold
                      positions or be trading the stocks we are recommending to you.</p>
                    <p><b>4. Terms.</b> The term of this Agreement is for the term of your subscription on an ongoing
                      basis. At the time of
                      subscription, you agree that you have been fully informed as to the cost of your subscription.
                      Your subscription will
                      renew automatically upon the expiration of either a) a month, or b) a year depending upon which
                      subscription choice you
                      made unless you have notified CT of your desire to cancel the service. Should you decide to cancel
                      during a month on a
                      monthly contract, there will be no further charge in the following month but there will be no
                      pro-rata reimbursement for
                      the month currently under way. Should you cancel your annual subscription, there will be no refund
                      of any kind. During
                      the year you have paid for, should you decide to cancel and then come back into the program, we
                      will accept you back if
                      your subscription is still within the 12 month period which you initially subscribed for. You
                      agree that you understand
                      that CT may, at any point during the term of this Agreement, change the pricing of its service to
                      new customers. After a
                      year, the monthly and an annual subscription automatically renews. Should the price of the service
                      change and your
                      service is renewed, you agree that the new pricing shall apply and you agree to pay that new
                      price. If there has been a
                      price change, CT agrees that we will notify our customers when and if our pricing changes. You
                      agree that you understand
                      fully that our recommendations performance is calculated by adding and subtracting the percentage
                      results from each
                      recommendation that we have made in both a buy and sell recommendation to get a realized gain/loss
                      result. We then add
                      the unrealized gain/loss to that figure from any open positions to get a total result. Our results
                      are audited each
                      quarter by a third party independent firm. Your results may differ greatly from this figure for
                      any number of reasons,
                      including your selection of some, not all, of our recommendations. It may differ because you are
                      not trading any short
                      positions. Your personal selection of our recommendations and how much you decide to buy or sell
                      of any of our
                      recommendations will vary your return from our recommendation performance figure. You agree that
                      you are subscribing for
                      stock ideas and cooking tips as well as the entertainment factor in our content and that you are
                      not relying exclusively
                      upon this site or its alerts or recommendations for your personal investments.</p>
                    <p><b>5. Payment.</b> You agree to pay the monthly fee and allow Carnivore Trading bill your credit
                      card each month until such
                      time as you cancel. You may cancel any time. Annual subscribers allow us to bill them annually if
                      they do not cancel.</p>
                    <p><b>6. Pricing Policies. </b>Carnivore Trading retains the right to change its pricing any time.
                      Should you sign up for a
                      monthly plan, we have the right to change that pricing at any time with notification. We will
                      notify you of any
                      intention to change pricing and at that time, you will have ample time to decide whether to
                      continue your service.
                      Again, you may opt out and cancel the service any time.</p>
