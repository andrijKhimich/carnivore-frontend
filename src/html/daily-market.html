                  <p>Market opened DOWN HARD on everything on the planet that has been going up
                    Carnivore Stocks were getting hit and stopped out all over the place in early trading.
                    Many of them bounced back, like NIO, but hey – it is what it is.
                    WKHS is off 20% and we still hold it. US Postal Service delayed it contract.
                  </p>
                  <p>We bought AMD, AAPL, AMZN with some of the capital from the sales, all just additions to existing
                    positions.
                    We added to SNOW but now it’s getting crushed in the aftermarket but recovering.
                    We shorted two more stocks as a test of a theory we have that the markets will open down hard in the
                    AM and then climb
                    up during the day tomorrow.</p>

                  <b>Morning Session</b>
                  <p>Ugliest opening in a long time.
                    Everything getting stopped out left and right.
                    Cutting our positions down, building cash for us automatically in the account.
                    Stops work great. Protects your capital. Once can be upset that the NIO and FSR that we just bought
                    got popped and sold
                    out because of stops, but you can’t look at it that way.
                    You have to be grateful for the stops protecting your account value.
                    So we can all live to trade another day.</p>
                  <p>We saw that AMDwas heading up, not down, so we added a ton to that position.
                    <b>Then we added to AAPL and AMZN, too.</b>
                    Trader Z logs in and agrees that the only place to hide in this situation is big cap tech.
                    Around and hour into trading and <b>DOW now only off -46 and NASDAQ off -46</b></p>
                  <p>I’m not taking this too be a recovery.
                    This might be a bounce in a big down day, so I’m sticking with the moves we made at the open and in
                    the first 30 minutes
                    and riding it.
                    We may even take more profits here and get leaner.
                    And sure enough, many started to roll over and head back down again.
                    Everything except AMD and AMZN and AAPL which are holding up.</p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Now DOCU and PDD are up.</b>
                    WKHS is still getting hit but has leveled off, but down 20% today.
                    It’s the only EV stock we didn’t get stopped out of. FSR and NIO are gone. It’s only the first hour
                    of trading and we’re
                    exhausted over here.
                    Lot of action.
                    Time to light the Palo Santo and take a break, turn on a little music.</p>
                  <p>Here’s about 2 hours of Native American Shamanic Flute Music:

                  <p>There, I feel much better. <br>
                    Unless the market is really messing with your head you don't need to listen to that. <br>
                    After 5 minutes that flute made me crazy!

                  <b>Afternoon Session</b>
                  <p>ere’s when you start to cut back your trading – bot in size and frequency…right now.
                    The sign is when you add to SNOW like I just did and within 30 seconds the stock is cratering, like
                    falling off a cliff.
                    I’m not perfect and this is the evidence of that.
                    Sometimes - in fact most of the time – my ability to enter a stock is pretty good.
                    But sometimes, you miss, and you miss immediately and bigly.
                    I just did that on SNOW.
                  </p>
                  <p>Fortunately, it announces earnings tonight and we’ve decided to play this through the earnings
                    announcement.

                    This can be dangerous, particularly now, since I think there’s about a 75% chance that the stock
                    sells off after the
                    announcement anyway, no matter how good the announcement is, just because that’s what the
                    environment is like out there
                    right now.

                  <p>
                    What’s your point, Dutch? You’re rambling!
                    My point is that there are signs that its time to back the hell up and take a breath and relax and
                    stop trading until
                    you understand the world better, think clearly again.
                    You don’t have to know why you’re trading badly, you just have to recognize that you are.
                    Then stop.<br>

                    Breathe.<br>

                    Lilt the incense.<br>

                    Chant something.<br>

                    Get your head straight.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes you just need to take the whole day off and do something totally different like go
                    golfing, hit the gym, take
                    a hike, go shoot guns at something.</p>
                  <p>At 2PM ET DOW – 23 NSADAQ off -42 but there are a lot of stocks still off -3% to -8% underlying the
                    index.

                    In the afternoon, we develop
                    the waterfall action theory and we shorted a couple stocks, almost at random, to test</p>

                  <h3 class="title-3">Market Commentary and Featured Articles</h3>
                  <p>Market Guidance</p>
                  <p>We say the action was constructive today because when the market opens down like this, pretty damn
                    hard, and then sucks
                    up the losses and goes positive in a lot of names, its not a bad thing, it’s a shake out. Think of
                    all the market makers
                    that took the stocks down, tripped all the stop loss orders, took in that stock, and then when the
                    hedgies and others
                    came in and started buying the “bargains” the market makers were unloading their positions
                    at huge gains today.
                  </p>
                  <p>That’s what we just saw happen. The Waterfall Pattern – A Market Action Theory <br>
                    What is going to be more interesting is if this pattern happens again over the next couple days.
                    <br>
                    If it does then this will look like a waterfall in the charts. Open down hard, climb back a bit.
                    <br>
                    But each new opening is a bit lower than the one the day before. <br>
                    That looks like a waterfall in the charts. <br>
                    If that pattern develops, it becomes a day trader market. <br>
                    Buy on the open (down hard) and sell near the close (after they climb up a bit.)
                    That’s the only way to make money in the waterfall market.
                  </p>
                  <p>Since we’re not day traders, that kind of keeps us out of the market, at least for new issues, and
                    all we can do is hang
                    onto the stocks that aren’t gong to get hit as hard.
                    The other thing we can do is find some decent short positions and reverse the trade.
                    Short at the close, cover in the AM when the market opens down hard.
                    Also just another version of a day trade, so not something we really like to do.
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT</p>
                  <p>It might be the only way to make money in December.
                    Tomorrow will give us an indication.
                    I might take a flyer today and short at the close to see if my theory is right.
                    And so we did.
                    Now we will see if we’re right.</p>

                  <p>We have opted to represent the performance of our recommendations in a very simple way. We take
                    every recommendation and
                    keep a running total of the gains and losses. We take the gainers and we add them up and we subtract
                    the losers for
                    realized gains or losses. For example, if we recommend 5 trades, and they are +10%, -5%, -5%, -5%
                    and +10%, we will show
                    our track record as +5.0%. If we make multiple buys of a stock and sell them all at once, every
                    “lot” is counted towards
                    the gain or loss equally. For example, we make 10 buys of 100 shares of a stock over a week totaling
                    1,000 shares at
                    different prices, then we sell 1000 in a block, each 100 share lot has a different gain or loss.</p>
                  <p>Each one is added to the gain or loss of the track record – we do not average the gain or loss on
                    the position. With a
                    winner this works to our favor but with a loser, it works equally against us. We started tracking
                    and making
                    recommendations on 3/18/2020 where our recommendation performance began at 0.00%. We assumed a $9.99
                    per trade
                    commission cost in and out until 7-1-20. Since 7-1-20 we report results with no commissions as there
                    are now several "no
                    commission" brokerage options available to the general public.</p>
