                  <b>Morning Trading</b>
                  <p><b>pFSR and PLTR</b> are booming up. The stocks that did well in the Pandemic are getting hit. The
                    announcement of a vaccine for
                    the phony virus is running all the hotels, the drug guys, all the DOW stocks that have been down are
                    now booming up, the
                    DOW +1400</p>
                  <p>NASDAQ stocks getting whacked but as morning trading continues, I get the distinct feeling that the
                    DOW will sell down
                    and the Tech stocks will recover.</p>
                  <p>We sell off some DOW stocks and we start lightly buying high quality tech as we see confirmation
                    that
                    the turn is
                    occurring in the tech stocks as we suspected might happen.</p>
                  <p>We sell 50% of our over 100% gain in the PLTR call option. Put the investment capital back in the
                    bank, let the profit
                    run for a month or two.</p>
                  <p>We sell all our FSR– turns out a bit too early as it just keeps on going up – Dutch sells too
                    early.
                    Didn’t expect FSRto
                    come around so fast, but I’ll take the gain. Hope you all got a good profit there.</p>
                  <p>NIO continues to run up.</p>
                  <p>The solar stocks are where they’re running to hide right now. All solar is up.
                  </p>
                  <p>We’re buying NOW, APPS, BABA, VEEV and STNE</p>

                  <b>Afternoon Trading</b>
                  <p> <b>FSR</b> now up 30% on the day.</p>
                  <p> <b>PLTR, NIO, TT, SUM, USCR</b> all up strong.</p>
                  <p>We dumped off the <b>TT-SUM-USCR</b> trio of stocks in the DOW strength.</p>
                  <p> <b>TREX</b> is struggling down -10.</p>

                  <b>This is a strange day.</b>
                  <p>Solar was up big in the AM, now trading into negative territory. <br>
                    We’re not in the sector now, having made our money and stepping aside just before the big slide in
                    those stocks. <br>
                    They seem to have had a lot of damage and need time to recover. <br>
                    Hard for me to see a “V” shaped recovery in anything that got smashed as hard as they did. <br>
                    As the day comes to a close the DOW starts to sell off hard and although it stays positive for the
                    day, a drop from
                    +1500 early in the day to +800 is a big sell off, a lot of profit taking, and its obvious that
                    others are coming to the
                    same conclusion that we have…that everything isn’t all rosy and the world didn’t just become
                    unicorns and rainbows over
                    night.</p>
                  <p>The NASDAQ sold off harder also and finished negative. <br>
                    We feel that the tech stocks aren’t done here. <br>
                    The world can be a very different place tomorrow when the money managers at the big funds see
                    opportunity to buy quality
                    growth like NVDA for example at a discount. <br>
                    They’ll come back in.</p>

                  <b>Re-Opening Trade is Back</b>
                  <p>We were a little early this year on the re-opening trade. <br>
                    We essentially had to abandon it for the most part and go with the tech stocks that were showing the
                    way. <br>
                    We did OK with it, We made some money in building materials and such, but we didn’t do great in the
                    hotels, casino’s,
                    restaurants, etc. <br>
                    Those are now back on the table it appears. <br>
                    Or at least, today they were. <br>
                    Until the late afternoon when the rest of the world realized what we did early on – this big pop in
                    the DOW wasn’t fully
                    warranted, and they began taking profits, just like we did in the AM. <br>
                    Look, I don’t like to go against the market and what it’s telling me, but these companies are by no
                    means “all good” in
                    one day, OK? <br>
                    Hard for me to see it. <br>
                    The damage these companies have incurred as a result of total shut down is huge.
                    And the stocks suffered also, so one could argue that they deserve to come back strong.
                    But if it happens all in one day, that’s not a trend. <br>
                    I’d like to see some follow through. <br>
                    What we’re likely to see is a retracement on todays action, then some basing out and support and
                    buying coming into
                    these groups.</p>
                  <b>Ex-Girlfriend QDEL Tries to Kill Us…Again.</b>
                  <p>Our biggest loser of all time was taken on QDEL a few months back. <br>
                    The stock dropped like 60 or 80 points in one day. We took at -43.9% loss on her last time. <br>
                    We were looking hard at going back in here on Friday and just didn’t by the grace of Oden’s beard.
                    <br>
                    It dropped ANOTHER -79.79 points today -28%. <br>
                    So when Dutch says he doesn’t like to go back to ex-girlfriends, this is why. <br>
                    I guess we could say that ex-girlfriends that treated you right can be bought again, but the ones
                    that sting you bad the
                    first time, you gotta steer clear!</p>
